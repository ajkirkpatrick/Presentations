# Power Outages...

### Cause expense .font50[`r Citet(myBib, c('andresenUnderstanding2023'))`]
- Food spoilage
- Health impacts
  - Medical equipment
  - Psychological
  - Increase in ER GI admissions following prolonged outage
- Crime

--
- Many of these are worse for vulnerable households
  - Safety (esp. non-English speaking)
  
--

### Are expensive to mitigate
- A 100% reliable grid is astronomically expensive
- Climate change
- Of interest to MPSC

#### Reliability as a public good
- Reliability is a public good, but can be local
- Undergrounding lines, tree-trimming

#### Private substitutes
- Households purchase private reliability ($2k-$20k)
- Some distribution of preference for reliability

$\rightarrow$ What can we say about the optimal level of grid reliability, and how does it vary with the distribution of preferences for reliability?

# Existing Lit

#### "Value of Lost Load"
- Extensive lit, estimates of WTP via averting expenditure, surveys

#### `r Citet(myBib, c('brehmBackup2024'))`
- Lower public reliability lowers electricity costs for all
- As private investment in reliability increases, the optimal public reliability decreases
- `r Citet(myBib, c('eppleEnds1996'))` "The Ends Against The Middle"
  - Public education: low-preference + high-preference coalition to keep spending down
  - A "voting model"


--
#### But
- Brehm et al. assume single measure of reliability (and investment)
  - Different service areas can have different reliability
  - People may sort on unobserved preferences

# Questions

#### 1. Are there differences in reliability across income?
- Speaks to incidence of costs, but not necessarily welfare

#### 2. Are there differences in private reliability across income x outages?
- Previous literature: yes
- Poorly identified

--

#### 3. Is there evidence of sorting by reliability?
- If **yes**, optimal public reliability in a service area is very unstable
  - Initial conditions (private investment) is important
- If **no**, optimal reliability for an area is likely the same mean reliability (inclusive of private provision) across all areas.
  - Less add'l public reliability investment should occur when more generators are present
  - Potential twist: Co-adoption of batteries with solar

# Next

### New MI data
- Tract-level outages for 10% most impacted tracts from MPSC
  - Monthly reporting (started in 2023) so .font-red[ongoing collection]
- Previously, granular data on outages didn't really exist
  - poweroutage.us is city-level
  - Most papers use poweroutage.us or county-level
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('ex1.png')
```
]


### Estimate
- Cross-sectional incidence of outages
- Hedonic value of reliability using CoreLogic transaction price
