# Power Outages

### Cause expense .font50[`r Citet(myBib, c('andresenUnderstanding2023'))`]
- Food spoilage

- Health impacts
  - Medical equipment
  - Psychological
  - Increase in ER GI admissions following prolonged outage
  
- Crime

--

- Many of these are worse for poor households
  - Safety (esp. non-English speaking)

--

### Are expensive to mitigate
- A 100% reliable grid is astronomically expensive

#### Private substitutes
- Households purchase private reliability ($2k-$20k)
- Some distribution of preference for reliability

#### Reliability as a public good
- Reliability is a public good, but can be local
- Undergrounding lines, tree-trimming

$\rightarrow$ What can we say about the optimal level of grid reliability, and how does it vary with the distribution of preferences for reliability?

# Existing Lit

### `r Citet(myBib, c('brehmBackup2024'))`
- Lower public reliability lowers electricity costs for all
- As private investment in reliability increases, the optimal public reliability decreases
- `r Citet(myBib, c('eppleEnds1996'))`
  - Public education: low-preference + high-preference coalition to keep spending down
  - "The Ends Against The Middle" (but a "voting model")


--

### But
- Brehm et al. assume single measure of reliability (and investment)
  - Different service areas can have different reliability
  - People may sort on unobserved preferences


---
class: MSU
# Questions

#### 1. Are there differences in reliability across income?


#### 2. Are there differences in private reliability across income?

--

#### 3. Is there evidence of sorting by reliability?
- If **yes**, optimal reliability in a service area is very unstable
  - Initial conditions (private investment) is important
- If **no**, optimal reliability for an area is probably the same mean reliability (inclusive of private provision) across all areas.
  - Less add'l public reliability investment should occur when more generators are present
  - Potential note: Co-adoption of batteries with solar

# Next

### Why hasn't anyone estimated sorting yet?
- Straightforward hedonic estimation
- Because granular data on outages doesn't exist
  - poweroutage.us is city-level
  - Most papers use this or county-level

### New MI data
- Tract-level outages for 10% most impacted tracts
- Monthly reporting (started in 2023)

--

### A. Cross-sectional incidence of outages

### B. CoreLogic transaction price for hedonic estimation
